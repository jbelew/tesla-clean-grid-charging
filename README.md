A proof of concept application to optimize charging your Tesla based using fossil free energy source. It was intended to bit much more than a PoC, but as of November 27 2023, Tesla pulled the plug on most of the API endpoints this application was based on.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
