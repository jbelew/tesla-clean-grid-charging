## Overview

# Tesla Charging Optimization App

As of November 27, 2023, Tesla has started disabling the core API endpoints crucial for the functionality of this app. The intended replacement is Tesla's new Fleet API; however, this is a paid service and currently beyond the scope of this project. Unfortunately, this means an end to this project (for now), but it was a great learning experience. 

~~Welcome to the Tesla Clean Grid Charging App â€“ a tool designed for Tesla owners with a passion for technology and environmental conservation. This app allows users to optimize their vehicle charging based on the availability of fossil-free energy on the grid, providing near real-time insights to enhance the sustainability of your Tesla ownership.~~

## Features

- Integration and orchestration of Tesla and Electricity Maps APIs.
- Minimal user data stored locally, ensuring privacy.
- Secure handling of API keys and secrets, never passed via the browser.
- Built with Node, React, Tailwind, and an rxjs messaging bus, leveraging the power of Next.js for a seamless experience.

## Motivation

This project stems from a desire to blend technology and environmental conservation, contributing to a better future. By minimizing the vehicle wake state and battery drain, we aim to make a positive impact on both energy efficiency and overall sustainability.

## Differentiation

Unlike existing solutions, our app goes beyond by offering the ability to save custom Home Assistant automations specifically tailored to minimize vehicle wake states and battery drain. No more compromise between automation and energy efficiency.

## Data Security

Your privacy is paramount. Minimal user data is stored locally and never shared externally. API keys and secrets are transmitted only via the server, never exposed through the browser.

## Future Plans

The roadmap includes exploring the migration to the Tesla Fleet API for enhanced functionality. However, it's important to note that this transition may involve considerations related to accessibility, as the Tesla Fleet API is behind a paywall.

## Contribution

Contributions and feedback are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to help improve this project.

## Acknowledgments

This project is made possible by the Tesla and Electricity Maps APIs. Special thanks to the open-source community for their continuous support.

Happy charging!
